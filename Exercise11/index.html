                        <p>
                            In this subtask you should set up the primary rays to start backward ray tracing.
                            A primary ray starts at the origin of the camera and shoots through a single pixel of the virtual sensor.
                            In the <code>Basic1.Render()</code> function we iterate over all pixels of the virtual sensor.
                            Follow the comments in the source code to set up one ray for each pixel and call the <code>traceRay(...)</code> function to start the ray tracing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you are done, you can change the number of pixels using the left slider and have a look at the rays emanating from the camera.

                    <subtask title="Intersection with Scene Primitives (i.e. Lines)" points="3">
                        <p>
                            In the previous subtask you called the <code>traceRay(...)</code> function.
                            This function intersects the given ray with the scene and computes the color at this point.
                            Your task is to implement the intersection function that intersects a ray with a line (<code>Line.prototype.intersect</code>).
                            If you have implemented the above mentioned functions you should now see the primary rays as gray dashed lines and the intersection points.
                        </p>
                    </subtask>

                    <subtask title="Ray Reflect Method" points="5">
                        <p>
                            Until now we do not consider indirect light.
                            To do so we have to shoot secondary rays and call the <code>traceRay(...)</code> function recursively.
                            Your task is to implement the <code>Ray.prototype.reflect</code> function.
                            Given an intersection point we consider two cases: a perfect mirror and perfect diffuse material.
                            A mirror perfectly reflects an incoming ray. Diffuse material reflects an incoming ray in a random direction of the hemisphere around the normal.
                            Follow the comments in the source code to implement this function.
                            If you have implemented the above mentioned function you can use the recursion depth slider above to adjust the recursion depth.
                            Play with the sliders to check the different cases.

            <exercise prefix="Advanced Exercises" title="Raytracing 1" points=10>
                <p>
                    In this exercise you will learn how to create an image by raytracing a three-dimensional scene.
                    The image will contain diffuse illumination and shadows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can switch between rasterization and raytracing by pressing <code>space</code>.
                    The rasterized result contains a sphere instead of the spikeball present in the raytraced scene,
                    and utilizes a simpler illumination model.
                    Therefore, the rasterized result does not serve as a reference solution,
                    but you can check whether your intersection tests are correct by comparing the sphere positions and sizes between rasterized and raytraced output.
                </p>

                            For every pixel, one ray is cast into the scene. This first ray is called the primary ray.
                            Compute the origin and direction of the primary ray in the <code>main</code> function of the fragment shader in <code>rt.glsl</code>.
                            <ul>
                                <li> Backproject the current fragment to world space using the <code>projView</code> matrix.</li>
                                <li> The origin is the camera position stored in the uniform <code>cameraPos</code>. </li>

                            Compute the ray-plane intersection in the function <code>intersectRayPlane</code> in <code>intersection_plane_sphere.glsl</code> 
                            by solving the following equation for $p$ (the intersection point) and $t$ (the distance of the intersection point from the ray origin):
                            \[ dt + o = p \]
                            \[ t > 0 \]
                            \[ p \cdot n = k \]                            
                            The ray is given by the origin $o$ and the direction $d$.
                            The plane is given by the normal $n$ and the distance $k$ to the origin.

                            Compute the ray-sphere intersection in the function <code>intersectRaySphere</code> in <code>intersection_plane_sphere.glsl</code> by solving the following equation for $p$ and $t$:
                            \[ dt + o = p \]
                            \[ t > 0 \]
                            \[ |p - c|^2 = r^2 \]

                            The sphere is defined by the center $c$ and radius $r$. 
                            When there are two solutions for the equation, choose the solution that is closer to the ray origin.
                            Use the following rule for the algebraic transformations:
                            \[ |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + 2(a \cdot b) + |b|^2 \]

                            The function <code>intersectScene</code> in <code>rt.glsl</code> computes the closest intersection point of a ray with the complete scene. The returned integer is the ID of the intersected object. If no intersection is found, -1 is returned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Call the intersection functions for all spheres, the plane, and the spikey ball. Keep track of the closest intersection point. Store the <code>IntersectionResult</code> object for the closest intersection in the parameter <code>out inter</code>.

                            Compute a Phong shading with diffuse, specular, and ambient term when an object is hit. 
                            The light source is a white directional light coming from the direction <code>lightDir</code>.
                            The surface normal is stored in the intersection struct and the object color is stored in the material.

                        <p>
                            We can add hard shadows to the scene in the following way: If the primary ray has hit an object,
                            shoot a "shadow ray" towards the light source and check if there is an object in between.
                            The diffuse and specular illumination from the previous step is now only added when nothing was hit (in our case: <code>objectId = -1</code>).
                            The uniform <code>shadowFactor</code> interpolates completely black shadows (<code>shadowFactor=1</code>) to no shadows (<code>shadowFactor=0</code>).

                        <p>

                                <li>Translate the origin of the shadow-ray epsilon along the normal direction to avoid self-shadowing. </li>
                                <li>The direction is the negative light direction. </li>
