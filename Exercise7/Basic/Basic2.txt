b. Compute the centers of the edges PA′,B′, PB′,C′ and PC′,A′ from A′, B′ and C′. Is the drawn inner triangle perspectively correct?
Which interpolation method do you know that would provide the same result?

No, it's not correct because the interpolation is done according to the projected points. So the real
distance between vertices is not used to calculate the position of the inner triangle.


c. Compute the transformed and dehomogenized centers of the edges P′A,B, P′B,C and P′C,A from PA,B, PB,C and PC,A.
Is the drawn inner triangle perspectively correct?

Yes, now it is correct because the inner triangle is computed from the "original" coordinates,
which means it "takes in consideration" the real distance of the vertices and the projection
is more pronounced (given that the points B and C are far from the plane).
