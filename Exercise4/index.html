            <exercise prefix="Basic Exercises" title="Affine Transformations in 2D" points=10>
                An affine transformation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by a $n\times n$ matrix  $\mathbf{A}$ and a vector $\vec{t}$:
                $$ f(\vec{x}) = \mathbf{A}\vec{x} + \vec{t} $$
                $\mathbf{A}$ is called the <b>linear part</b> and $\vec{t}$ is called the <b>translational part</b> of $f$.

                            A rotation transformation can be substituted by a series of shear transformations:

                        <p>
                            Given two affine transformations $f_1$  and $f_2$
                            with linear parts $\mathbf{A}_1$,
                            $\mathbf{A}_2$ and translation vectors $\vec{t}_1$, $\vec{t}_2$ respectively, the composition $f_2 \circ f_1$ is also affine:
                            $$f_1(\vec{x}) = A_1\vec{x} + \vec{t}_1 \text{ and } f_2(\vec{x}) = A_2\vec{x} +\vec{t}_2 \Rightarrow (f_2 \circ f_1)(\vec{x}) = A_{1,2}\vec{x} + \vec{t}_{1,2}$$
                            Determine its linear part $A_{1,2}$ and its translation vector $\vec{t}_{1,2}$.

                            Implement the corresponding formula in the function <code>Basic1_3.CompositeAffineTransformations()</code>.
                            Below you see from left to right the input triangle, the triangle transformed with $f_1$, the triangle transformed with $f_1$ and $f_2$ in succession and the input triangle transformed with the composition of both transformations.
                            Note that the two rightmost triangle images should be the same.

                    <subtask title="Affine Mapping" points=2>
                        <p>
                            In the following we consider the two-dimensional case $(n=2$).
                            Given three points
                            $$P_0=[a_0, b_0], \quad P_1=[a_1, b_1], \quad P_2=[a_2, b_2],$$
                            show that there is a unique affine mapping $f$ such that
                            $$
                            f([0,0])= P_0, \qquad f([1,0])= P_1, \qquad f([0,1])= P_2
                            $$
                            and determine its linear part and its translation vector.

                            Using this mapping you can transform the unit triangle (with the vertices $[0,0]$, $[1,0]$, $[0,1]$) to an arbitrary other triangle (with vertices $P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$).
                            Implement the formula in <code>Basic1_4.ComputeMapping()</code>.
                            The result is shown below. On the left you see the unit triangle and on the right the target triangle. In the middle you see the transformed unit triangle.

                <task title="Transformation of Normals" points=1 submitfile="Basic2.js">
                    <p>
                        This task deals with the effect of linear transformations on objects' normals.
                        In the leftmost image, you can see a rectangle and its normals.
                        The picture in the middle shows both the rectangle and the edge normals transformed with the same linear transformation,
                        a shearing operation along the $x$ axis. Obviously, the normals lose their defining behaviour when transformed with the
                        shearing transformation: They are not perpendicular to the edges anymore.
                    </p>
                    <canvas class="floatRight" id="canvasBasic2" width=600 height=200 data-call="Basic2.start" data-call-src="./Basic/Basic2.js">
                        <img class="wait">

                    <p>
                        Therefore, in order to transform normals correctly, you need to set up a new linear transformation stored in the so-called
                        normal matrix. Find the creation of the normal matrix in the lecture, implement it
                        in <code>Basic2.js</code> and achieve correct normals in the rightmost picture.
                    </p>
                </task>

                <task title="Solar System Simulation in 2D" points=3 submitfile="Basic3.js">
                    <p>
                        From the first exercise you know that an affine transformation has the form:
                        $$ f(\vec{x}) = \mathbf{A}\vec{x} + \vec{t} $$
                        Thus, the transformation consists of a multiplication and an addition.
                        We now reformulate the transformation to:
                        $$ \hat{f}(\vec{x}) = \left( \begin{array}{c} f(\vec{x}) \\ 1 \end{array} \right) = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{A} & \vec{t} \\ {\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0 \end{array}} & 1 \end{array} \right] \left( \begin{array}{c} \vec{x} \\ 1 \end{array} \right)$$
                        As can be seen, by lifting the coordinates from 2D to 3D, we can represent the affine transformation as a linear transformation.
                        The new coordinate $\left( \begin{array}{c} \vec{x} \\ 1 \end{array} \right)$ is called homogeneous coordinate.
                        For this task we want you to work in homogeneous coordinates.
                        The composition of two affine transformations in homogeneous coordinates is a simple matrix-matrix multiplication of the corresponding matrices.
                        Have a look at the vertex shader <code>shader_default.vs</code> to see how the transformation is applied.

                        In this task you are asked to implement the rotation and translation of the luminaries in a solar system.
                        Note that some luminaries rotate around others resulting in a hierarchical structure.
                        A luminary consists of several attributes like its radius, the radius of the orbit, the color and the shader program used to draw the luminary.
                        The most important attributes are the <code>luminary.speed</code> value which specifies the rotational speed of the luminary around the parent object
                        and the <code>luminary.modelMatrix</code> which places the luminary relatively to the parent object in space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are asked to implement the recursive <code>Basic3.drawLuminary()</code> function.
                        The function is called with the root of the solar system - the sun (see <code>drawScene()</code>).
                        For each luminary, you have to concatenate three matrices:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the rotation matrix that rotates the luminary around its parent object (has to be set up by you)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the matrix that places the luminary with respect to the parent object in space (is stored in <code>luminary.modelMatrix</code>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the parent model matrix (is given as an argument in <code>modelMatrixParent</code>)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        First set up the rotation matrix. Next, concatenate the three matrices together - be careful with the order!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, you have to call the <code>drawLuminary()</code> function recursively for each child, passing on the computed model matrix.
                    </p>

                Enter the path to the folder <code>precomp_vs2015_64</code> (ended by /) and hit OK.
                Then click on "Configure", choose "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" and hit "Finish". 
                Click "Generate" to obtain a Visual Studio solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the .sln file in the <code>build</code> folder.
                Open it and in the solution explorer, right-click the "cg" project and click "Set as StartUp Project".
                Be sure to add the <code>bin</code> folder to your Visual Studio library path.
                To do so, right-click the project again and go to Properties->Configuration Properties->Debugging and put "PATH=%PATH%;path-to-precomp\precomp_vs2015_64\bin;" into the Environment field.
                Compile and run with Visual Studio.                 
                If the shaders/objects cannot be loaded, make sure that the Project Directory is set to the Advanced folder. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to use a different version of Visual Studio, you can compile and install the dependencies yourself using CMake and Visual Studio. 
                Then use CMake like in the explanation above with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set to the location where you installed the dependencies.

            <exercise prefix="Advanced Exercises" title="Affine Transformations in 3D" points=10>
                <p>
                    In this exercise, your task is to create a simulation of the solar system consisting of sun, earth and moon in 3D. 
                    We use measured parameters from the actual solar system to create a more or less realistic simulation. 
                    The final result should look like the image below. 
                    You can run the reference binary <code>advanced_reference</code> to validate your results.

                <ul>
                    <li>The earth revolves around the sun in a circle (It is actually an ellipsis, but we use an approximation here). The plane containing this circle is called ecliptic plane. </li>
                    <li>To keep it simple, we define the ecliptic plane as the x-y plane.</li>
                    <li>By default, the camera is looking in -z direction with x pointing to the right and y upwards. </li>
                    <li>The camera can be controlled with W,A,S,D and the left mouse button.
                    <li>The sun is at the origin (0,0,0) of our coordinate system and all given parameters are relative to it.</li>
                    <li>The loaded models for the planet and the ring have a radius of 1.</li>

                        All your work has to be done in the method <code>CG::update(float dt)</code> in <code>cg.cpp</code>. 
                        Before you start, have a look at the header <code>cg.h</code>. 
                        All relevant parameters are defined here. 
                        These parameters can be modified at runtime through the GUI. 
                        Times are scaled such that 1 earth day equals to 1 second. 
                        The <code>timeScale</code> parameter lets you speed up or slow down the simulation.
