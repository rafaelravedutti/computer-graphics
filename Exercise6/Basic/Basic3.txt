With very small numbers of line segments the variety of color is small
even though there are many points inside the segment because the color is interpoleted
(for the Gouraud shading this effect is minimized, but still present).
For the phong shading the vectors used in the calculations are interpolated (normals and positions),
giving each fragment it's own lighting, and a smoother transition.
